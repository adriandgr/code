### `print("Hello, class!");`


### what to expect from this course

This course will not teach you everything to know about programming or
electronics. But it will teach you valuable things. It will teach you the
basics which are foundational for all programming and electronics. It will also
help you develop new ways of solving problems, and open up new opportunities.
It will give you the knowledge you need to start building things, and the tools
to learn even more.

More concretely, we will use `Processing` to introduce you to programming.
Processing is great way to begin programming, because it is designed both for
ease of use and simplicity. It was conceived with the visual artist in mind but
continues to rely on important computer science concepts applicable to any modern
computer language.

Then we will learn about electronics, and build simple projects with the use the
`Arduino` platform. We'll learn useful techniques and skills necessary to bring
the computational and interactive elements of programming into the physical world.


### why do we need a GitHub course plan?

We're both thrilled to see that you're enjoying the workshops that we've prepared for
you so far. Now, that you've had a bit of exposure to the world of
[Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) and [Processing](http://processing.org/),
we believe that we'll all benefit from some added structure to focus our goals
and have the best use of our time.

Please refer to the course schedule before to look at detailed lesson plans and
summarized notes to help you along the way.
