#### 1. Current, voltage, resistance, ohm's law

#### 2. AC vs DC!


#### 3. How to use a multimeter?
These are the most common functions of a multimeter:

 - Continuity testing with piezo buzzer
 - Resistance test down to 10 ohm (or lower) and up to 1 Megaohm (or higher)
 - DC voltage test down to 100mV (or lower) and up to 50V
 - AC voltage test down to 1V and up to 400V (or 200V in the US/Canada/Japan)
 - Diode testing

And some additional capabilities of advanced multimeters:

- Auto-off - to keep from draining the batteries
- AC and DC current test, from 10mA to maybe 200mA and then also a 10A one as well
- Stand - a thing that flips out and keeps it upright on your table
- Auto-ranging - note: some people don't like auto-ranging because its slower and not as precise
- Hold - keep the maximum value on the screen so you can probe without looking at the meter.
- Common battery - such as 9V or AA's, pocket meters use hard-to-replace coin cells
